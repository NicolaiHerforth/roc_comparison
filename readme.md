## Installation
The script requires matplotlib and SKlearn to run.

# Usage
Import the script into your python code as you would any other package.
You can either use the script to simply plot the ROC for a single model (provide true labels along with predicted probabilities) with the function "plot_roc", or compare the ROC and AUC between two models using the function "compare_roc".
